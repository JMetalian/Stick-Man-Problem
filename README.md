# Stick Man Problem

According to problem, a stick-man has to jump across obstacles with a magnitude but that magniute is not known. The jumping factor (magnitude) then found by via Simulated Annealing Algorithm in Unity. 

Implementation-wise, the project is not focused on hieararchy or optimization. So the code base is quite messy. Unity is used as a scientific development environment.
